# Interview UI

## Description

Interview UI is used for the scheduling and storing of interviews. On first load the user will be prompted  
 to log in with their [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) or if the user does
not have one then they will have the option to generate a new one.  
The user will then be taken to the homepage where they will have the option to schedule a new interview.  
 Existing interviews will be displayed next to the scheduling form and any newly scheduled  
 interviews will be updated and displayed immediately after submission. The user will also be able to  
 find their UUID displayed in the header alongside a "Log Out" button. Upon logout the user is taken
back to the login page,  
 successfully signed out.
